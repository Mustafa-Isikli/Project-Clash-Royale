    <p class="game-description">“Use Star Points to unlock cosmetics for your Max Level cards!”</p>
    <p class="star-points-description">Star Points are used to unlock cosmetic changes for Cards. Star Points can be spent to upgrade level 13 cards and give them Star Levels. Cards with Star Levels have golden particle effects and golden clothing,
      armor, weapons, or other elements added to their sprites in battle. They also glow gold while being deployed. Star Levels do not have any effects on interactions; they are purely cosmetic. All cards currently have at least one Star Level, with
      some having two or three.</p>

    <!-- Obtaining Section -->
    <h4 class="list-title">Obtaining</h4>
    <li class="list-item-1">Players can obtain Star Points once they reach King Level 13. Once Level 13, Star Points replace Experience gained when donating and upgrading cards. Collecting max-level Cards in any way (from Chests, Quests, trading) will award Star Points as well as Gold (1 for each Common, 10 for each Rare, 100 for each Epic, and 1,000 for each Legendary.)</li>
    <li class="list-item-1">Also, when max-level Cards are bought from the Shop, they are transformed directly into Star Points. Since the Cards overflown also convert to Gold, half of the Gold spent this way is refunded. This means for non-Legendary Cards, the player will get 1 Star Point for 5 Gold, but for Legendary Cards, you get 1 Star Point for 20 Gold.</li>
    <li class="list-item-1">However, Cards that the player has collected enough of to upgrade them to the max level, but have not been upgraded to the max level, will not award Star Points.</li>
