      <p class="cards-text">Cards are the only method of deploying troops, spells, and buildings onto the battlefield. Deploying cards costs Elixir, which is gradually gained during battle. Cards are primarily obtained through buying them with Gold or Gems in the Shop,
        or through finding them in Chests. Cards can also be received through trading or through clan members fulfilling requests. Duplicate cards obtained will fill up an upgrade meter. Once the meter is full, you can upgrade the card with Gold. All
        health and damage statistics are increased by roughly 10% per level. Cards that are able to spawn troops, such as the Goblin Hut and Witch, will have their spawned troop level increased by 1 per level.</p>

      <h4 class="list-title">Types of Cards</h4>
      <p class="list-text">There are three main types of cards: troops, spells, and buildings. Generally, spells are temporary and can be cast anywhere in the battlefield, while buildings (which are stationary), troops (which can move) can only be spawned on your territory (with the exception of the Miner.) There are also 4 card rarities: Common (signified by grey or pale blue), Rare (signified by orange), Epic (signified by purple) and Legendary (signified by a rainbow gradient). Each rarity has a different number of levels.</p>
      <ul>
        <li class="list-item-1">Common cards have 13 different levels, ranging from level 1 to level 13.</li>
        <li class="list-item-1">Rare cards have 11 different levels, ranging from level 3 to level 13.</li>
        <li class="list-item-1">Epic cards have 8 different levels, ranging from level 6 to level 13.</li>
        <li class="list-item-1">Legendary cards have 5 different levels, ranging from level 9 to level 13.</li>
